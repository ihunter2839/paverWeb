Things to note during development

Styles have sizes, sizes have different pallet quantities and potentially different min sqft purchase and color
    -Give each size an optional colors field of special colors to add to the base colors for the style
    -Convert size object to string to standardize data format 
    
For pieces that can be sold individualy, minimumOrder should be the total sqft of 1 piece
